Focusing on case studies like the Latin American anti-poetry movement, the Arabic prose poem and the work of the LANGUAGE poets, we will familiarize ourselves with debates in lyric theory and a variety of poetic traditions.",

How do the elements of environmental writing underscore the means by which to enliven forms of care, repair, and belonging towards a post-extractive world? We attend to Indigenous, Africana, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Global South perspectives, modes of narration, visuality and experimentation asking throughout how gender and sexuality shift what we know and how we write about it.
