She was born during the period of Reconstruction, and passed away the same year as the ruling of Brown vs. Board of Education was made, which will allow for a study of her participation in laying the foundation for the Modern Civil Rights Movement. Students will also gain experiential learning by visiting historic sites which preserve the legacy of Bethune, including the Mary McLeod Bethune Council House-National Historic Site and the Carter G.

When Black and brown bodies have historically been sites of colonial and gendered violence, what does it mean to center the body as a site of knowledge production? This course draws upon the emergent performance and aesthetic practices as disruptions of colonial violence; and their relationship to racialized, gendered, and sexual power dynamics. This course will deeply consider what it means to be (in)human, erotic reconfigurations of being, and fugitive practice. We will draw from frameworks in performance studies, Black feminism, women of color feminism, and queer theory to understand the body as a living archive of memory, violence, and liberation. Such attention to performance and aesthetic practices entail not only histories of conquest and genocide, but the creative and life-bearing practices that transcend these conditions of captivity and loss.",

Examining recent literary, filmic, and televisual representations of US slavery, this course foregrounds racial slavery in the establishment of longstanding socioeconomic and political asymmetries across race, gender, and class in the US. And it analyzes the ways in which imaginative depictions of racial slavery seek to address and ameliorate such asymmetries. Our class will pay particular attention to how contemporary Black writers and filmmakers thematize labor, love, gender, power, pleasure, community, and resistance among the enslaved and their descendants.",

This course will consider how fiction and ethnography can each inform yet trouble the other, beginning from the premise that both involve a kind of magic. Using the same building blocks \u2013 seemingly humble and ostensibly available to all --writers of fiction and ethnography alike create what one contemporary author has called \u201clanguage-made hallucinations, fabrications that persuade us to believe in them.\u201d Yet these \u201cfabrications\u201d often have different stakes and use different methods for revealing human \u201ctruths.\u201d We\u2019ll explore such divergences and alignments by seeing what is provoked when juxtaposing fiction, ethnography, and even other genres of writing (poetry, journalism, creative non-fiction, etc.). Writing assignments for the course, as befits the content, are flexible with respect to genre.",

Anthropological approaches will be used to analyze questions of sovereignty, security, and justice, as we will trace their meanings across disjunctive cultural and legal terrains.",

This course explores how these communities, often marked by asymmetrical power relationships between the Roman State and local communities, developed, investigating social structures, religion, art and architecture, and economies in order to understand what it was like to live on the edge of the Roman world.",

However, they are also a powerful model system to tease out the genetic and molecular details of protein folding. Research labs utilize yeast as a model system to study several cellular mechanisms, but this entire body of work comes from just two different yeast strains. And yet, wild yeast grow everywhere in our everyday environments outside of the research lab; nature has provided rich genetic diversity among these yeast species that go unstudied in a research setting. In this COEX course, you will investigate novel protein-folding phenotypes in these unidentified wild yeast strains.",

This will be accomplished by studying several human diseases and designing experiments to better understand their mechanistic and molecular basis. (Diseases will be chosen out of a series of options by students early in the semester.) The class will consist of didactic lectures, discussions, small group work, and group presentations. Active participation by all students will be encouraged. Students should have a solid background in the life sciences with an understanding of the fundamental principles of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, and cell biology. Readings will be assigned from Robbins Basic Pathology (2018), Junqueira\u2019s Basic Histology Text & Atlas (2018), primary literature, and reviews. Both textbooks are available",

These modern metaphors continue a long history of equating female sexual allure with dangers found in/or capable of subverting Nature. This course will use contemporary methodologies to make sense of similar descriptions of women found in Greco-Roman literature: how do the Greeks and Romans express a concern about gender, ethnicity, class, and/or politics using these metaphors? How do these same categories help distinguish what is \"natural\" from \"unnatural\"? To what end does this discourse about women and nature affect law, public space, or other aspects of \"civilization\"?",

Far from simply assimilating Greek myths and changing the names of divinities and heroes, the Romans were highly creative in their adaptation of myths from various other cultures. They had a rich store of myths and legends of their own, including dual foundation stories for Rome itself (Aeneas and the Trojans; Romulus and Remus) as well as mytho-historic tales of exemplary heroes and heroines (e.g. Horatius and Lucretia) whose exploits provided models for future Roman generations. Even obviously flesh-and-blood persons (e.g. Regulus, Hannibal, Caesar, Cleopatra) take on mythical status. We'll focus on the ancient material - literature, art, architecture, religious rituals - with a look as well at the rich reception of Roman mythology in later literature and art. We'll consider also the way the Romans themselves understood \u2013 and manipulated \u2013 their myths.",

Psychologists are primarily interested in detecting limits to human rationality, whereas economics tends to proceed within the rational-actor model. In business, questions arise of how theoretical models and empirical findings related to the practice of managerial decision-making. Investigations of power and the psychological impact of money are relatively recent additions to the suite of research topics. New methodologies, such as neuro-imaging have led to advances not represented in the traditional framework of organizational psychology.

We will consider how social processes are implemented at the neural level, but also how neural mechanisms help give rise to social phenomena and cultural experiences, such as political polarization. Many believe that the large expansion of the human brain evolved due to the complex demands of dealing with social others\u2014competing or cooperating with them, deceiving or empathizing with them, understanding or misjudging them. In this course, we will review core principles, theories, and methods guiding neuroeconomics, and leverage these tools and theories to better understand our current political landscape and polarized attitudes. Overall, this course will introduce students to a multi-level approach to understanding the brain in its social context, through the lens of neuroeconomics,",

The seminar explores how colonialism has been put on trial by generations of anti-colonial activists and thinkers such as Abd el-Kader or Fanon. Putting colonialisms on trial means also putting history itself on trial alongside archives, reparations, museums, the subterranean, capital, religion, and the very notion of a court in its globalized liberal hegemonic form. A laboratory for collective investigation, this seminar will draw on our respective works. This dialogue will engage students in researching their own traces of colonialism\u2019s violence.",

Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.",

Mantras are central to Indian religions\u2014not only Hinduism, but also Jainism, Buddhism, Sufism, and Sikhism. Some mantras are made up of words and language\u2014usually in Sanskrit\u2014while others are sound fragments with no semantic meaning. The sacred syllable OM, now a global symbol of Eastern spirituality, exemplifies the power and authority of mantra. What are mantras? What do they accomplish? How do they shape identities, beliefs, and practices? Engaging with sacred utterance in various media, this course explores the world of mantras in India and beyond.",

Like many other systems of thought around the world, the Daoist tradition approached these questions both through the creation of texts, teachings, and theory, and through the development of at times extremely complex embodied contemplative practices. Starting from a perspective of a person not as a unitary, monolithic entity, but rather as a composite of energies and influences, these practices seek to harmonize, balance, and transform the person. This course will explore how the possibilities of personal transformation were expressed in Daoist contemplative literature from the first centuries CE up to the modern day. Contemplative practice labs will also offer students an opportunity to explore the ideas in the texts through direct experience. No prerequisites.",

Suzuki, to the Beat Zen of the 1950\u2019s and the establishment of centers of Zen practice, we will help you to appreciate in your own lives what the Daily Show calls your \u201cmoments of Zen.\"",

Questions about the nature of the self have informed the speculations of philosophy, the soteriologies of religion, the trajectories of self-cultivation in contemplative traditions, and the therapeutics of psychology. Recently, cognitive science and phenomenology have developed new explanations for how multiple senses of self shape lived experience and give rise to various self-concepts. Students in this course will engage with dimensions of selfhood that we often take for granted by studying senses of self from multidisciplinary and cross-cultural perspectives.",

It focuses on functional programming, which provides a new experience for students who have already done some programming and a solid foundation for students who have never programmed at all. Students learn to design solutions to computational problems, solutions that are compact, elegant, and efficient. Over the course of the semester, the computational problems addressed grow in complexity, from simple (e.g. long addition) to moderate (e.g. implementation of one programming language in another) to sophisticated (e.g. an implementation of an AI game player for two-person games of complete information). We study clear and precise formulation of computational problems, use of recursion, and rudimentary analysis of algorithms. The emphasis is on problem solving and insight and crafting beautiful things rather than on coding.",

In practice, we often do not face worst-case scenarios, and the question arises of how we can tune our algorithms to work even better on the kinds of instances we are likely to see, while ideally keeping a rigorous formal framework of analysis. In this graduate seminar course, we will review several alternatives to worst-case analysis, developed largely in the theoretical computer science literature over the past 20 years, and their most notable algorithmic applications.

Economists often need to test the validity of competing theories and to analyze government and business policies. Econometrics provide them with the necessary tools. The course starts with an exposition of descriptive statistics and essential probability concepts. Then, students will be introduced to statistical inference, estimation and hypothesis testing. The second half of the course will be devoted to regression analysis. Theory will always be illustrated with examples, and emphasis will be placed on the connection between the theory and actual data processing. This practice will be reinforced by computer lectures, where students will go over homework, and familiarize themselves with RStudio, a computer software commonly used by economists for data analysis. This course is a prerequisite for many applied economics courses at Brown and for higher level econometrics",

It examines: (i) the determinants of the growth process since the emergence of Homo sapiens, (ii) the roots of the dramatic transformation in living standards in the past two centuries, and (iii) the role of deeply rooted geographical, institutional, and cultural characteristics as well as human diversity in the uneven development across the countries and regions. The analysis proposes a resolution for some of the most fundamental mysteries of the journey of humanity: What trapped humankind in poverty for most of human existence? What sparked the massive metamorphosis in living standards over the past two centuries? And what led to the emergence of immense inequality across nations?",

This class attempts to answer these questions by studying the emergence of realism as the dominant literary form in the late nineteenth century, reading the work of writers such as Henry James, Thomas Hardy, Stephen Crane, Edith Wharton, and Charles Chesnutt. Our aim will be to develop a working definition of realism, and to understand why it proved such an appealing genre. In the process we will touch upon some of the major intellectual and social developments of the period, such as Darwin\u2019s theory of evolution, Freud\u2019s theory of the unconscious, the rise of the mass media, the triumph of consumerism, mass immigration, and the system of Jim Crow segregation.",

Historically, it was the year of the Space Shuttle Discovery\u2019s maiden voyage; ongoing famine in Ethiopia; the continuing Cold War; the Macintosh computer; and the shooting of four African-American teenagers on the New York subway. Culturally, 1984 brought us Ghostbusters and The Terminator; Louise Erdrich\u2019s Love Medicine and Milan Kundera\u2019s The Unbearable Lightness of Being; Prince's Purple Rain; the creation of Tetris; and the rise of the infomercial. By focusing on a single year, we consider how culture and politics intertwine in an unfolding history, and how myths animate lived experience. Works by Erdrich, Kundera, John Edgar Wideman, Jayne Anne Phillips, Martin Amis, in addition to film, television, and music.",

In the first place, what counts as \u201cliterature,\u201d and why does it need\u2013or does it?--to be studied? Should we study a literary work as an entity unto itself, or does context play such a crucial role in the generation of meaning that we mustn\u2019t ignore it? Or is it somehow necessary to treat a work of literature as both entirely independent and completely saturated with its cultural moment? We\u2019ll explore these and many other problems inherent to the study of what is called literature. Authors may include Judith Butler, Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and others.",

As this potentially interminable catalogue suggests, the late is not invariably attached to notions of mastery or wisdom, ripeness or completion, as the signifier of a desired end. In Late Style, Edward Said aligned lateness with \"intransigence and unresolved contradiction,\" indeed, with a kind of failure.

It provides the foundation for further study in engineering. The course begins with engineering design, followed by the analysis of static structures. Topics also include CAD, basic Matlab programming, professional ethics, and social responsibility. Led by an undergraduate mentor, students complete group design modules, which require an additional two hours of meeting time per week. We highly recommend that students have taken MATH 0100 or higher at Brown, or have completed the equivalent of AB calculus or higher in high school.",

Thousands of warehouse robots autonomously zip around each other in a highly structured and specialized environment that makes coordination look easy, while military robots are often teleoperated by more than one person, making coordination difficult. Moving beyond highly controlled scenarios presents many challenges. Most importantly, mobile robots will interact in complex environments with other robots and people. How can we ensure robots safely do what we want them to do? What are the ethical ramifications of multirobot systems? In this course, we study the past, present, and future of coordinated mobile robotics, including a discussion of ethics.

Co-taught by an interdisciplinary team (a coastal ecologist and an oceans governance scholar), this course will explore questions such as: What management tools are available? What do they do (and not do) and how? How are they created and managed in particular contexts? Who gets to decide and why?",

Still, the number of people who are hungry, food insecure, and/or malnourished is stable or increasing in various parts of the world. As global population rises, calls to further increase and intensify agricultural production ring out across the globe. Through (agro-)ecological, feminist, and justice lenses, we will explore the political economy of food insecurity and agriculture, the political ecology of agricultural development, and critical humanist approaches to the past, present, and future of farming. We will connect with human geographers, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, Indigenous scholars, Black Studies scholars, feminists, and people working outside of academia.",

For each author we will read one play and one novel, to consider how form inflects writerly projects, and conversely to consider, through the lens of each writer's project, the specific potentialities and limits of form.

Since its most recent renaissance in the mid-2010s, the Sapphic has emerged as an elusive disruptor; an umbrella term that welcomes lesbians, wlw, nonbinary and trans femmes and mascs. This seminar explores how the Sapphic functions not just as an identity category but a methodology (a way of reading, writing, looking, listening) and an aesthetic in art, design, fashion, and food. What are the ways in which the Sapphic works with/against lesbian and queer political identities? How does contemporary use of the Sapphic diverge from its past iterations in literature, literary criticism, and visual culture? How might we understand temporality in Sapphic expression (slow-burn, yearning)? Competency in Sapphic arts requires participation in seminar discussions, completion of 3 short essays, and a final essay/creative project.",

Drawing from philosophical, decolonial, theological, psychoanalytic, sociological, feminist, queer, and trans discourses, this interdisciplinary course explores such concepts as Glissant\u2019s \u201cright to opacity,\u201d Sedgwick\u2019s ignorances and nonce taxonomies, and \u017di\u017eek's theory of ideology as fetishistic disavowal. Texts will include Beauchamp\u2019s Going Stealth, Derrida\u2019s \u201cHow to Avoid Speaking: Denials,\u201d Freud\u2019s \u201cFetishism,\u201d Glazer\u2019s Zone of Interest, C.

What are the ways to trace the presences and absences of the colonial Anthropocene? How do we write, visualize, engage with the disappeared and extinct, but also the processes of metamorphosis, metabolics, desire, and queer and trans ecologies that are entangled with anthropogenic crisis? How do the elements of environmental writing underscore the means by which to enliven forms of care, repair, and belonging towards a post-extractive world? We attend to Indigenous, Africana, Latinx, Asian, Arab, and Global South perspectives, modes of narration, visuality and experimentation asking throughout how gender and sexuality shift what we know and how we write about it. Through refining our literary and visual arts, frequencies, and embodied engagements, we address collective practices that erode and unwrite the Anthropocene.",

A third case, indicaged by the names trobador, trouv\u00e8re and troubadour, opens yet another field: of invention, discovery, and unexpected turns. This seminar will explore all three manifestations of poietic, dichterische or inventive explanations with what is called language in both their incompatibilities and similarities. Texts to be read and discussed will include Emily Dickinson, Ezra Pound and George Oppen; Martin Heidegger, Paul Celan, Emil Staiger, Eduard M\u00f6rike; Sappho, Plato, Aristotle, Jesper Svenbro; Cicero, Quintilian, Jacques Roubaud, Jean de La Fontaine, Guillaume IX d\u2019Aquitaine, Daniel Arnaut, and Jaufre Rudel.",

Urban planning strategies are developed to carefully insert the proposed building into a hybrid, densely populated urban context within a city. Students will be briefed to either design a residential housing project or a large public building. Students will analyze the built environment and character of the site to create contextual building designs that strengthen a neighborhood. The final presentation will require a complete set of drawings, renderings, a shared urban context model, and a large-scale model of the proposed building design. A jury of invited architects and professors will conduct a discussion of each project in an exhibition-like setting at the List Art Center. This course can be repeated once for credit.",

They practiced a piety in which human flourishing depended on gestures, rituals, and built articulations of devotion mediated by beauty. But holy powers could also be malevolent, so ancient art served to protect, warn, or ward off evil spirits. This course will explore the art, architecture, and material cultures of ancient Greeks, Romans, Jews, and Christians between the 6th century BCE and the 6th century CE. We will consider a wide variety of evidence, including texts, sculpture, frescoes, mosaics, architecture, and domestic artifacts, to explore the many ways in which these distinct but connected communities expressed their beliefs through visual representations and material practices.",

Uninterrupted contact produced richly complex patterns of cultural exchange whose legacy is variously embraced and debated today. This first-year seminar will examine relationships between Muslims, Jews, and Christians from the perspectives of literature, music, art, architecture, archaeology, and history. While largely focusing on the centuries of co-existence, we will also consider the expulsions and forced conversions of Jews and Muslims that took place after 1492, as well as the resurgence of these communities in contemporary Spain.

The intersection of the court and the city that rapidly expanded around it made Madrid not only Spain\u2019s imperial capital, but its cultural capital as well through a confluence of overlapping and competing social interests. Topics include: negotiations of the global and the local in historical chronicles and municipal festivities; the centrality of the theater in urban socialization; the use of poetry for self-fashioning; the transmission of political news. We will study authors canonical (e.g., Lope de Vega, Calder\u00f3n, Zayas) and lesser known (e.g., Li\u00f1\u00e1n y Verdugo).

Throughout, we explore the pivotal role of the Middle East\u2014and narratives of its past\u2014from a variety of \u201c3D\u201d perspectives, including geopolitics, water, and fossil fuels; religion/spirituality, law, and family life; art, literature, music, and sports; and nationalism, militarism, humanitarianism, and environmentalism.",

From salmon and migratory birds to wildfires, plastic pollution, and climate change, the course covers the 1800s-2000s. Tuesday lectures will alternate with collaborative readings & short writing assignments based on primary sources, including oral histories, court transcripts, and government documents on Thursdays, with the goal of building new ways of linking law, sovereignty, and ecological change. Readings will be supplemented with secondary works of history, anthropology, theory, ecology, and guest visits from regional experts and Elders. Previous coursework in history, Native American & Indigenous Studies, or ecology is a plus but not required.",

Psychoanalytic knowledge added the inner, mental (psychic) lives of people and cultures. Psychoanalysis redefined the humanities, the social sciences, and their relationships, paving the way as well for new approaches such as gender and sexuality studies. We will focus on the role of psychoanalysis as a political science, attuned to the modes of mass and media politics of the 20th and 21st centuries.",

Whether blaming social media platforms, partisan disinformation campaigns, or a full-scale crisis of democracy itself, in attempting to explain the apparently expanding reach of a conspiratorial habit of mind, observers have mostly stressed its recent origins. But what if we approached the present situation as a reflection of lasting tensions long visible in the history of American political culture? This class considers the history of conspiracy theories as a symptom of longstanding anxieties about the state of American democracy and the vitality of the modern public sphere. From the Salem Witch Trials to the January 6th insurrection, we adopt conspiracy as a lens through which to explore the historical relationship between power and knowledge.",

Part II involves readings on forestry laws from the British colonial period (1757-1947) in South Asia. Part III involves reviewing a series of books and films on environmental history in Asia. Part IV involves researching case studies focusing on local environment cultures from the postcolonial period (1947 to present) in South Asia.

We will read proponents of imperial expansion, advocates of imperial reform, and fierce critics of imperialism. Readings will include canonical texts authored by major historical figures such as John Locke and Vladimir Lenin as well as pamphlets and legislative debates that document the everyday practice of imperialism. In engaging with such primary sources, we will consider how rival visions of imperialism shaped ideological traditions as diverse as liberalism, fascism, conservatism, and communism.",

Among the topics we will explore are the ways contemporary carceral regimes have been shaped by the afterlives of slavery; the shifting meanings of rehabilitation; the experiences of incarcerated individuals; the Cold War politics and transnational roots of militarized policing in the United States; and the ways gender, sexuality, and age shape imprisonment across the hemisphere.",

Despite our growing awareness of the legacies and current realities of oppression, the deeper history of the mobilization of resistance to pervasive oppression in the past has become obscured by the passage of time, and misunderstood through selective citation and decontextualization. By carefully analyzing and contextualizing the writings by earlier generations we can thus better understand our own time, how we got to where we are, and how we can steer our future to safer and more just shores. Some great minds in the past have thought about the questions that concern us today. This course introduces students to these voices in the belief that they can serve as a guide to grasp the complexities of our own time.",

But faces, as deepfakes have shown, are also utterly replicable: they can be grafted, mimicked, appropriated, forged. Our collaborative humanities seminar will delve into the representations of faces (portraits, self-portraits, selfies, close-ups), the classification of faces (Johann Kaspar Lavater\u2019s physiognomy, the iconography of hysteria, Cesare Lombroso\u2019s Criminal Man), the staging of faces (pornography), the racial politics of faces (Blackface, facial recognition, Frantz Fanon\u2019s notion of mask), and the philosophy of \u201cfaceity\u201d (Gilles Deleuze, Jean-Luc Nancy, Giorgio Agamben).",

We briefly review the history of inter-state relations, including the international legal basis for diplomatic relations. Diplomacy has evolved over the years and has been greatly influenced by modern technology; however, it continues to incorporate such common functions as policy formulation, representation, reporting, negotiation, intercultural contacts and interaction with the media, parliamentary bodies and other external actors.

From literature to film/tv series, from photography to visual art to poetry, artists have politically engaged, challenged and modified the idea of resistance embedded within the identity of contemporary Italians. We look at artistic expressions of resistance performed against different forms of power (nationalism, the colonial state, the patriarchal family, the Mafia, the Church, police violence). We interrogate how the idea of resistance comes to structure Italian culture today and how it reverberates in mainstream narratives of what it means to be Italian.",

We will investigate the intricate ways in which literature reflects and shapes the nation's identity, addressing profound themes such as war, family, religion, race, and sexuality. Through the lens of both celebrated and lesser-known Italian authors like Elena Ferrante, Pier Paolo Pasolini, Elsa Morante, and Italo Calvino, we will delve into the narratives that have influenced Italy's sociopolitical landscape. Complementing our literary exploration, film adaptations offer a vivid counterpoint, illustrating the pervasive influence of literariness in Italian culture. From Italy\u2019s rapid industrialization to its experiences with democracy, totalitarianism, and imperialism, this course invites you to traverse the transformation of a nation and the powerful stories at its heart.",

To accomplish this, we will pair the tools of linguistic analysis with social theory on gender. Topics include historical developments in the field of language and gender, speech act theory and performativity, grammatical gender, and sociolinguistic style and indexicality. Throughout the course, we will consider how intersections with other social identities \u2013 such as race, class, sexuality, and age \u2013 inform how people construct gender through language and how these intersections impact which communities have historically been prioritized in research in this area.",

Although there are many different ways in which syntactic structure varies across languages, this variation is not limitless; it is subject to principled constraints, and different logically independent dimensions of variation often turn out to be highly correlated with one another. This course explores language universals and the range of cross-linguistic variation in the domain of morphosyntax, what limits this variation appears to have, and what functional, formal, and semantic principles underlie this variation.",

What is reading, historically, theoretically, and in the digitally mediated future of culture? If reading brings language into being, then how should we read and what should we compose to be read? Readings from Saussure and Ong to Hayles, Derrida, and beyond. Optional critical-creative project.",

We will then survey these genres as well as the histories of R&B, House and Techno and some of their many offshoots (Jungle & Afrobeats, for instance) have developed over the last 30 years to ask how popular music functions as one of the main channels of communication among the cultures of the African diaspora.

We will not only examine the films themselves alongside the speculations they have inspired, but also attempt to define the complex pleasures \u2013 somatic, cinematic, and cerebral \u2013they elicit from viewers.",

While doing so, we will explore art\u2019s potential to craft counter-narratives and generate new poetics of retrieving and preserving; of holding in common(s). Key topics include feminist shadow archives, queer-life and leaky archives, archives of feelings, speculative-critical fabulation, AI-generated mean-images, and ungovernable, incomputable data. Through video, digital media, and AI-hacking workshops, analysis of art case studies, and theoretical explorations, students will develop a major research-driven art project. This project can manifest as an AI-based artwork, sound piece, video, performance, curatorial intervention, writing, and more.

We seek to decenter the liberal humanism of environmental thinking to present modes of being that emerge from the otherwise of the Am\u00e9ricas. This imaginary is pluralistic in its linguistic, racial, ethnic, and gendered imagination. It foregrounds submerged perspectives and unearths subterranean stories that confront legacies of (neo)colonialism, racial capitalism, and extractivist exploitation. Guest participants \u2014 with the support of the Brown Arts and Cogut Institutes, Modern Culture and Media, and Portuguese and Brazilian Studies \u2014 enliven our study across the U.S., Turtle Island, and Abya Yala (the Indigenous nomenclature for the Am\u00e9ricas).",

These stakeholders will determine whether the problems that concern you reach the agenda; whether your preferred solution is adopted; how that policy solution is implemented; whether it diffuses from one political venue to another; and whether the policy endures, or reshapes politics, succumbs to termination or reform.

Building on existing scholarly approaches to the role of play in human flourishing, it asks how play structures music, sports, and game in ways that are comparable, how the different modalities of each activity give rise to unique principles of play and competition, and how these three domains interact with one another. Topics will include musical improvisation and competition, in forums ranging from rap battles to air guitar; the role of sound in professional sports marketing and in-game experience design; the songs that enliven children\u2019s games and the soundtracks of video games; forms such as capoeira, which involve playful interaction in several different domains; and many more.",

The range of answers gave birth to a musical style that looked backwards into the Baroque for textural density and flow, abandoning the articulated symmetry of the classical phrase, while pushing the harmonic language, musical drama, and effect into new horizons. All the while, the search for alternative structures and points of musical departure, resulted in a new sort of interaction between music and other art forms. Schumann\u2019s E.T.A Hoffman\u2019s inspired character pieces, Berlioz\u2019s program music, the proliferation of the Lied, Liszt\u2019s Dante Sonata and Petrarca sonnets are telling examples of this search for a new musical style and context.",

We will transcribe, deal with questions such as \u201chow to play without sheet music,\u201d and address aesthetic issues, diverse lineages and context. We will analyze other artists\u2019 improvisations, learn how to improvise ourselves, and obtain the tools necessary to develop our craft independently. You will need your instrument, voice, and - most importantly - your ear. Music and instrumental proficiency is required. A questionnaire will serve as a prescreening. Access to the seminar will be given via override approval.",

We will explore pathbreaking works that involve spatialization, alternative tunings, and improvisation. Orchestras are natural vehicles for new ways of thinking about sound and the concert experience, but in dealing with economic realities and a commitment to canonical practice, they are also the most resistant to change. What are the limitations and expectations of music created for these institutions? How is cultural prestige at play, and what roles do artistic administrators, composers-in-residence, publishers, and critics play in programming? And how might new initiatives for young composers and underrepresented voices change relationships to audiences?",

The teaching method employs a communicative and cultural approach designed to develop both language proficiency and cultural competence. This is achieved through activities related to specific functions, contexts, grammar, and vocabulary relevant to everyday life situations in an indigenous community. Sessions are highly participatory and interactive, and small group work is often used. The course is mostly taught in Nahuatl to encourage its use and practice in classes.",

The course integrates biophysical, computational, single neuron and human studies. In addition to lectures and readings, students will learn how to build computational models to simulate neural dynamics at various scales from single neurons to networks, using Matlab and the Human Neocortical Neurosolver. Computational modeling will be taught hands-on in an interactive lab session each week. DO NOT REQUEST AN OVERRIDE FOR THIS COURSE.

A related idea is so-called structural injustice (e.g., structural racism or sexism) in which a society is wrongful in its structures and institutions in some way irrespective any wrongful individual members. In this seminar we will study the difficult philosophical problems each of these ideas raises.",

The course centers issues of power, ethics, positionality, and reflexivity in the context of qualitative research with minoritized populations and discusses community- and arts-based participatory research approaches. The course also addresses methods for combining qualitative and quantitative research findings in the context of a mixed-methods research approach. Students will have the option to analyze their own or others' qualitative data.",

Although our focus is on the development of methods in the field of epidemiology, what constitutes an \u201cepidemiologic method\u201d has become less clear as the lines dividing fields have blurred.

After surveying the typology of trials we will examine the building blocks of trial design, including rigorous development of goals and endpoints, examination of methods for intervention assignment, and use of blinding. The course discussion will turn to statistical approaches for designing, implementing, and analyzing the results of trials. Although the emphasis will be on frequentist methods for design, sample size and power considerations and analysis and reporting of trial data.",

Although the common narrative in our field is that the complex social, political and ideological challenges we're facing is unprecedented, an examination of the history of public health in acute crises reveals that many struggles confronting us today are neither entirely novel nor unique. This course posits that public health experts rarely understand the full nature of previous crises, and argues that a better understanding of historical events will improve our response to future crises. Through thoughtful reflection and interactive discussion, we will explore the oft-repeated themes that continue to challenge public health and humanitarian response to this day, and examine the progress we\u2019ve made as a field. Most importantly, we will question why lessons identified so often fail to become lessons learned.",

We will begin with seminal works by directors such as Andrzej Wajda, Roman Pola\u0144ski, Andrzej \u017bu\u0142awski, and Krzysztof Kie\u015blowski, exploring their unorthodox aesthetic innovations and thematic preoccupations, including Poland\u2019s infamous legacy as a site of excessive violence during the Second World War, as well as the existential condition of individuals under socialism. Subsequently, we will transition to the post-communist era, focusing on contemporary efforts to revisit Poland\u2019s past through haunting explorations of Polish-Jewish relationships, attentiveness towards minority groups, and the darkly comedic depictions of \u201cthe provincial\u201d in films by Pawe\u0142 Pawlikowski, Ma\u0142gorzata Szumowska, and Wojtek Smarzowski, among others.",

Throughout the semester, we will see that there is significant variation within Africa in the strength of states, levels of economic growth, and respect for democratic institutions; we will aim to explain these variations. We will primarily study events in particular African countries, but will also examine broad patterns across countries and use social science concepts and methods to try to explain them. In our exploration, we will mostly build on the work of political scientists but also draw heavily on work by journalists, psychologists, economists, and historians.",

Some estimates suggest that 90% of laws in the United States arise government agencies, not from elected legislatures. When do public bureaucracies abet democratic governance? When do they disrupt or abet anti-democratic political forces? What roles do \u201cpublics\u201d play in \u201cpublic bureaucracy?\u201d This course on public bureaucracy considers these questions\u2014and many more\u2014through its systematic study of bureaucratic structures, politics, operations, and implications for democratic governance. The course provides opportunities to critique and construct theories and empirical analyses of public bureaucracies. It also provides opportunities for students to prepare for the comprehensive exams and to develop research agendas. This graduate course counts either as an American Politics or Comparative Politics elective for the doctoral program in political science, and it does not have prerequisites.",

This sub-field has roots in International Political Economy, Fiscal and Economic Sociology, and Economics. It has as its main foci the politics of economic growth, distribution and (in)equality. The growth program emerged from work on comparative capitalisms in the 1970s and 1980s, coalescing in the highly influential Varieties of Capitalism literature in the 2000s, and latterly in the Growth Models research program. The distributional strand of work focused on the interaction of producer groups and sought to tie political and economic outcomes to the relative strength of such groups. The (in)equality side of the subfield emerged out of studies of welfare states and engagement with the social metrics of comparative economic performance. This course surveys this broad terrain.",

This course investigates the central role that religion and spirituality have played in the long, tangled history of psychedelics, from colonial eradication of psychedelics as indigenous sacraments, to psychedelic modes of expanding consciousness in 1960s counterculture; from the moral panic around these substances as a tool of mind control, to their present scientific investigation as a panacea for mental health, addiction, and self-realization. Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.",

Interweaving primary sources and scholarly accounts on psychedelics, our inquiry will use an interdisciplinary approach, blending religious studies, philology, anthropology, the history of science, and art history. To explore this varied terrain, we survey the history of divine drugs around the world, even as we ruminate on the wisdom and philosophy they have inspired over the ages.",

Sociology explores the workings of societies large and small: nations, organizations, communities, families, and other groups. How do societies shape action and identity, and why are social pressures so hard to defy? How do societies distribute wealth and power, and why do inequalities so often coalesce around race, ethnicity, class, and gender? How do established practices persist, and when do movements arise to challenge them? Examining such themes across a range of issues and topics, this course provides a springboard for future study throughout the social sciences.",

What is power and who has it? These questions have motivated generations of sociologists, but many of the arguments continue to be informed by the foundational classical theorists: Karl Marx, Max Weber, Emile Durkheim and W.E.B Du Bois. Looking at the transformations around them \u2013 the rise of capitalism, the modern nation-state, rational bureaucracy, the spread of colonialism, the decline of religion, struggles for emancipation and much more \u2013 they developed arguments that allow us to better understand ourselves, our actions, and the contemporary political, economic and social transformations around us.

It examines how individual attitudes, actions, and interactions make a difference for organizational processes and outcomes. This focus is contrasted with more macro-level approaches, which take the organization (instead of the individual) as the primary unit of analysis. For example, studies of organizations from an economic perspective are typically concerned with the performance of the organization relative to its competitors. Studies of organizations from a macro-sociological focus are typically concerned with an organization's routines and structures, contextualized by the broader environment. SOC 1311 takes a more micro and meso perspective that asks questions such as, \"why do individuals in organization behave the way they do, how does this affect the organizations of which they are a part and how, in turn, are individuals affected by their organizations?\"",
